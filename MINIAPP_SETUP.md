# FarGuard Miniapp Setup Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Your FarGuard miniapp is now properly configured to work in **both Farcaster and Base App** environments, as well as regular web browsers.

### ✅ Key Updates Made:

1. **Smart Environment Detection**: App now detects if it's running in a miniapp vs web browser
2. **Auto-Connection**: Automatically connects using verified Farcaster addresses when available  
3. **Wallet Fallback**: Falls back to MetaMask/wallet connect for web users
4. **Proper Manifest**: Updated `/.well-known/farcaster.json` with correct format for both platforms
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when miniapp features aren't available

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### In Farcaster/Base App:
- ✅ Auto-detects miniapp environment
- ✅ Fetches real user data (FID, username, profile)
- ✅ Auto-connects with verified addresses
- ✅ Calls `sdk.actions.ready()` to hide splash screen
- ✅ Full miniapp features enabled

### In Web Browser:
- ✅ Detects web environment 
- ✅ Falls back to MetaMask/wallet connection
- ✅ All core functionality works
- ✅ No errors or splash screen issues

## 🧪 Testing

### Test in Web Browser:
```bash
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Test Miniapp Detection:
```bash
# Visit the test page
open http://localhost:3000/test-miniapp.html
```

### Test in Farcaster:
1. Share your deployed URL in a cast
2. Click the miniapp from the feed
3. Should auto-connect and show user data

### Test in Base App:
1. Open Base app
2. Navigate to your miniapp URL
3. Should detect environment and connect

## 📱 Key Features Restored

✅ **Auto-Connect**: Uses Farcaster verified addresses  
✅ **Real User Data**: Shows actual FID, username, profile  
✅ **Multi-Chain**: Works on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum  
✅ **Token Approvals**: Fetches and displays real approvals  
✅ **Revoke All**: Batch revoke using your deployed contract  
✅ **Activity Tracking**: Shows wallet transaction history  
✅ **Risk Assessment**: Analyzes approval risk levels

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
REACT_APP_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_key
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_key  
REACT_APP_INFURA_API_KEY=your_key
REACT_APP_BASESCAN_KEY=your_key
REACT_APP_ARBISCAN_KEY=your_key
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Build passes without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Manifest exists at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` 
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] App works in web browser
- [ ] Test page shows miniapp detection
- [ ] Revoke contract deployed on Base (✅ already done)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Not connecting in Farcaster"
- Check console logs for SDK errors
- Verify manifest at `yourdomain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`
- Ensure `sdk.actions.ready()` is called

### "Revoke All not working"
- Must be on Base chain (contract deployed there)
- Check wallet connection
- Verify approvals are loaded

### "No data showing"
- Check API keys in environment variables
- Verify wallet address is correct
- Check console for API errors
